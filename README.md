# CMU-CS-Academy-Projects
These are some of the projects I've done as part of Carnigie Melon University Computer Science Academy.
They are all written in python and don't work in normal IDEs, only CMU's code editor.
Click the links below to run my programs. I will put the projects' code in this repository.
